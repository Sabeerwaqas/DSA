/*
    List:

    => A list is a collection of items that are all of the same types(grocery items, integers, and names).
    => The items, or elements are stored in some particular order.
    => It is possible to insert new elements into various positions in the list and remove any element
    of the list.
    => List is a set of elements in a linear order.
        For example: data values a1, a2, a3, a4 can be arranged in a list:
        (a3, a1, a2, a4)
    In the above list, a3 is the first element, a1 is the second element and so on.
    => The order is important here, this is not just a random collection of elements, it is an ordered
    collection.

    Following are the some list operations in C++

    createList()
    copy()
    clear()
    insert(x, ?)
    remove(?)
    update(x, ?)
    find(x)
    length()
