    Asymptotic notation:

        It is a mathematical tool to represent time and space complexity.   
        There are three asymptotic notation.

        1) Big-O Notation (O-notation) - Worst case complexity
        2) Omega Notation - Best case complexity
        3) Theta Notation - Average case complexity

***** Big-O Notation *****

    The worst case complexity of algorithm is represented by Big-O notation.
    Big-O notation describes the complexity of an algorithm using algabraic
    terms.

    It has two important characteristics:

    1) It is expressed in terms of input.
    2) It focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the
    minute details.
