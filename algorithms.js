    Asymptotic notation:

        It is a mathematical tool to represent time and space complexity.   
        There are three asymptotic notation.

        1) Big-O Notation (O-notation) - Worst case complexity
        2) Omega Notation - Best case complexity
        3) Theta Notation - Average case complexity
